        <p>Chicken Chili is a heavy comfort food, definitely not a low calorie alternative to regular chili, but well worth the amount of warmth this dish can provide. It's pretty close to common beef chili but white and creamy instead of red and spicy, and most importantly, can be made in a single stockpot for the people who don't want a huge mess!</p>
